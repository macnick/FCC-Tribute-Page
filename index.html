          New Zealander Burt Munro was a motorcycle land-speed record-holder of
          the 1960s. One of his dreams was to run his homebuilt 1920 Indian
          Scout motorcycle, dubbed the Munro Special, on the Bonneville Salt
          Flats in Utah. He saved for years in spite of limited means to make
          the trip to America. He finally came over on a shoestring budget in
          1962. Munro was 63 at the time with a bad heart, yet he still managed
          to overcome numerous obstacles to set world records, even as a muffler
          was burning the flesh on his leg. In 1967, Munro coaxed his beloved
          streamlined Indian to 183.58 mph. That set a record in the category of
          "streamlined motorcycles under 1,000cc." To qualify, he made a one-way
          run of 190.07 mph, the fastest ever officially recorded speed on an
          Indian.

          <h3>Records</h3>
          <ul class="">
            <li>
              In 1962, he set a 883 cc class record of 288 km/h (178.95 mph)
              with his engine bored out to 850 cc.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1966, he set a 1000 cc class record of 270.476 km/h (168.07
              mph) with his engine punched out to 920 cc.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1967, his engine was bored out to 950 cc and he set an under
              1000 cc class record of 295.453 km/h (183.59 mph). To qualify he
              made a one-way run of 305.89 km/h (190.07 mph), the fastest-ever
              officially-recorded speed on an Indian. The unofficial speed
              record (officially timed) is 331 km/h (205.67 mph) for a flying
              mile.

              In 2006, he was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

              In 2014, 36 years after his death, he was retroactively awarded a
              1967 record of 296.2593 km/h (184.087 mph) after his son John
              noticed a calculation error by AMA at that time.

            <p>
              "The World's Fastest Indian" Munro's inspirational story was made
              into the movie "The World's Fastest Indian" in 2005. The movie,
              starring Anthony Hopkins and directed by Roger Donaldson, was met
              with favorable reviews. Many in the motorcycling community called
              "The World's Fastest Indian" the best motorcycle movie since the
              legendary documentary "On Any Sunday" made in the early 1970s.
